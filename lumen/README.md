# Getting started: Hello World!

1. Install Lumen

    `composer global require "laravel/lumen-installer=~1.0"`

    Make sure to place the `;C:\...\Composer/vendor/bin;` directory in your PATH so the lumen executable can be located by your system.

    or:

    `composer create-project laravel/lumen --prefer-dist`

2. Start a web server

    `cd lumen`

    `php artisan serve`

3. Browse to http://localhost:8000, and you should see it running!
